# Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for Balancing Accuracy and Computational Efficiency in Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

This repository presents an implementation of **Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)** designed to balance model accuracy and computational efficiency in **machine learning workflows**. The project leverages the **Adaptive Evolutionary Optimization Framework (AEOF)** to enhance scalability, adaptability, and performance. 

By integrating **machine learning models** with **evolutionary computation**, our approach addresses key optimization challenges such as:

- **High-dimensional and multimodal objective handling**
- **Premature convergence and inefficient exploration-exploitation balance**
- **Computational bottlenecks in large-scale optimization tasks**

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Evolutionary Optimization Framework (AEOF):** Enhances **convergence speed**, prevents **stagnation**, and optimizes **high-dimensional search spaces**.
- **Dynamic Operator Control:** Improves convergence by adjusting evolutionary operators based on real-time feedback.
- **Diversity-Preserving Mechanisms:** Ensures exploration across the entire search space, mitigating premature convergence.
- **Surrogate Modeling for Expensive Evaluations:** Reduces computational costs while maintaining **high solution quality**.
- **Pareto-Optimal Solutions:** Achieves a balance between **accuracy** and **efficiency** with **multi-objective trade-offs**.
- **Benchmark Experiments:** Validates the framework against **standard datasets**, demonstrating superior performance over traditional optimization techniques.
